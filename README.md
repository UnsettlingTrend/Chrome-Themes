# Chrome-Themes
Simple, colored Chrome themes for developer use.

## What is this?
I prefer to use different Chrome profiles/users for different projects, that way I can keep my links/logins/etc. organized. One thing that also helps is having a different look to each profile/user. Once I got past a basic blue, yellow, and red, just clean, simple themes seemed to be hard to come by. So, I started making my own. Trust me, it wasn't exactly rocket science...

## Installation
If all you want is the theme, just download and run the .crx file of the theme you want. If you'd like to alter one, you'll want to clone the repo (or just copy the directory of the theme you want to start with), possibly edit it (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/themes), package it up into a .crx (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging), then run it.
